No more champagne and the fireworks are through
Here we are, me and you, feeling lost and feeling blue
It's the end of the party and the morning seems so gray
So unlike yesterday, now's the time for us to say
Happy New Year, Happy New Year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend
Happy New Year, Happy New Year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't, we might as well lay down and die
You and I
Sometimes I see how the brand-new world arrives
And I see how it thrives in the ashes of our lives
Oh yes, man is a fool, and he thinks he'll be okay
Dragging on (ooh) feet of clay (ooh), never knowing he's astray
Keeps on going anyway
Happy New Year, Happy New Year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend
Happy New year, Happy New Year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't, we might as well lay down and die
You and I
Seems to me now that the dreams we had before
(Had before) are all dead, nothing more than confetti on the floor
It's the end of a decade in another ten years' time
Who can say (ooh) what we'll find (ooh), what lies waiting down the line?
In the end of '99 ('99)
Happy New Year, Happy New Year
May we all have a vision now and then
Of a world where every neighbor is a friend
Happy New Year, Happy New Year
May we all have our hopes, our will to try
If we don't, we might as well lay down and die
You and I
